# VMware Cloud Director Quickstart Terraform Configs

The VMware Cloud Director  Quickstart Terraform configs can be used to create the needed
infrastructure for a Kubernetes HA cluster. Check out the following
[Creating Infrastructure guide][docs-infrastructure] to learn more about how to
use the configs and how to provision a Kubernetes cluster using KubeOne.

[docs-infrastructure]: https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubeone/v1.8/guides/using-terraform-configs/

## Setup

In this setup, we assume that a dedicated org VDC has been created. It's connected to an external network using an edge gateway. NSX-V is enabled in the infrastructure since the sample configs only support NSX-V, for now.

The kube-apiserver will be assigned the private IP address of the first control plane VM.

### Credentials

Following environment variables or terraform variables can be used to authenticate with the provider:

| Environment Variable | Terraform Variable |
|------|---------|
| VCD_USER | vcd.user |
| VCD_PASSWORD | vcd.password |
| VCD_ORG | vcd.org |
| VCD_URL | vcd.url |

To use access token instead of username and password:


| Environment Variable | Terraform Variable |
|------|---------|
| VCD_AUTH_TYPE | vcd.auth_type |
| VCD_API_TOKEN | vcd.api_token |
