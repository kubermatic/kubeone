# vSphere Quickstart Terraform configs for Flatcar Linux

The vSphere Quickstart Terraform configs can be used to create the needed
infrastructure for a Kubernetes HA cluster. Check out the following
[Creating Infrastructure guide][docs-infrastructure] to learn more about how to
use the configs and how to provision a Kubernetes cluster using KubeOne.

These Terraform configs are supposed to be used with Flatcar Linux.

We also provide Terraform configs for [Debian-based operating systems](../vsphere)
and [CentOS-based operating systems](../vsphere_centos).

## Required environment variables

* `VSPHERE_USER`
* `VSPHERE_PASSWORD`
* `VSPHERE_SERVER`
* `VSPHERE_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_SSL`

## How to prepare a template

See <https://github.com/kubermatic/machine-controller/blob/master/docs/vsphere.md>
