# vSphere Quickstart Terraform configs for CentOS-based operating systems

The vSphere Quickstart Terraform configs can be used to create the needed
infrastructure for a Kubernetes HA cluster. Check out the following
[Creating Infrastructure guide][docs-infrastructure] to learn more about how to
use the configs and how to provision a Kubernetes cluster using KubeOne.

These Terraform configs are supposed to be used with CentOS-based operating
systems (e.g. CentOS 7 and RHEL). It's required that the template VM support
using [vSphere `guestinfo` datasource][guestinfo] to be able to use these
configs. For more information on how to prepare a template VM to be used with
these configs, check out our [CentOS 7 Template VM] guide.

> **Note**
> You might have to adjust [`cloud-config-metadata.tftpl`](./cloud-config-metadata.tftpl)
> file depending on your vSphere environment and setup. This file contains the
> network configuration for VMs. We configure the network to use IPv4 and DHCP,
> which might not work for all vSphere environments.

We also provide Terraform configs for [Debian-based operating systems](../vsphere)
and [Flatcar Linux](../vsphere_flatcar).
