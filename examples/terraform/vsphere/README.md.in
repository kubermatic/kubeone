# vSphere Quickstart Terraform configs for Debian-based operating system

The vSphere Quickstart Terraform configs can be used to create the needed
infrastructure for a Kubernetes HA cluster. Check out the following
[Creating Infrastructure guide][docs-infrastructure] to learn more about how to
use the configs and how to provision a Kubernetes cluster using KubeOne.

These Terraform configs are supposed to be used with Debian-based operating
systems that support vApp (e.g. Ubuntu). For more information on how to prepare
a template VM to be used with these configs, check out our [Ubuntu Template VM]
guide.

We also provide Terraform configs for [CentOS-based operating systems](../vsphere_centos)
and [Flatcar Linux](../vsphere_flatcar).

## Required environment variables

* `VSPHERE_USER`
* `VSPHERE_PASSWORD`
* `VSPHERE_SERVER`
* `VSPHERE_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_SSL`
