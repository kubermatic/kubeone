`kubeone` is a CLI tool and a Go library for installing, managing, and upgrading
Kubernetes High-Available (HA) clusters. It can be used on any cloud provider,
on-prem or bare-metal cluster.

## Project Status

As of v0.6.0, KubeOne is in the beta phase. Check out the 
[Backwards Compatibility Policy][6] for more details on
backwards compatibility, KubeOne versioning, and maturity of each KubeOne
component.

Versions earlier than v0.6.0 are considered alpha and it's strongly advised to
upgrade to the v0.6.0 or newer as soon as possible.

## KubeOne in Action

## Features

* Supports Kubernetes 1.13+ High-Available (HA) clusters
* Uses `kubeadm` to provision clusters
* Comes with a straightforward and easy to use CLI
* Choice of Linux distributions between Ubuntu, CentOS and CoreOS
* Integrates with [Cluster-API][7] and [Kubermatic machine-controller][8] to
  manage worker nodes
* Integrates with Terraform for sourcing data about infrastructure and control
  plane nodes
* Officially supports AWS, DigitalOcean, GCE, Hetzner, Packet and OpenStack

## Installing KubeOne

The easiest way to install KubeOne is using `go get`:
```bash
go get -u github.com/kubermatic/kubeone
```
However, running of the master branch introduces potential risks as the project
is currently in the alpha phase and backwards incompatible changes can be
expected.

Alternatively, you can obtain KubeOne via [GitHub Releases][9]:

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/releases/download/v0.6.0/kubeone_0.6.0_linux_amd64.zip
unzip kubeone_0.6.0_linux_amd64.zip
sudo mv kubeone /usr/local/bin
```

If you already have KubeOne repository cloned, you can use Makefile to install
KubeOne.

```bash
make install
```

## Kubernetes Versions Compatibility

Each KubeOne version is supposed to support and work with a set of Kubernetes
minor versions. We're targeting to support at least 3 minor Kubernetes versions,
however for early KubeOne releases we're supporting only one or two minor
versions.

New KubeOne release will be done for each minor Kubernetes version. Usually, a
new release is targeted 2-3 weeks after Kubernetes release, depending on number
of changes needed to support a new version.

In the following table you can find what are supported Kubernetes versions for
each KubeOne version. KubeOne versions that are crossed out are not supported.
It's highly recommended to use the latest version whenever possible.

| KubeOne version | 1.14 | 1.13 | 1.12 | Supported providers                                |
|-----------------|------|------|------|----------------------------------------------------|
| v0.6.0          | +    | +    | -    | AWS, DigitalOcean, GCE, Hetzner, Packet, OpenStack |
| v0.5.0          | +    | +    | -    | AWS, DigitalOcean, GCE, Hetzner, OpenStack         |
| ~~v0.4.1~~      | -    | +    | -    | AWS, DigitalOcean, Hetzner, OpenStack              |
| ~~v0.4.0~~      | -    | +    | -    | AWS, DigitalOcean, Hetzner, OpenStack              |
| ~~v0.3.0~~      | -    | +    | -    | AWS, DigitalOcean, Hetzner, OpenStack              |

**Note:** Versions v0.2.0 and v0.1.0-beta0 don't support upgrading to the newer
Kubernetes version.

## Getting Started

We have a getting started tutorial for each cloud provider we support in our
[documentation][10]. For example, the following document shows
[how to get started with KubeOne on AWS][11].

A cluster is created using the `kubeone install` command. It takes a KubeOne
configuration file and optionally Terraform state used to source information
about the infrastructure.

```bash
kubeone install config.yaml --tfjson tf.json
```

To learn more about KubeOne configuration, check out
[the example configuration file][12].

For advanced use cases and other features, check the [KubeOne features][13]
document.
