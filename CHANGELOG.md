# Changelog

# [v0.5.0](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/releases/tag/v0.5.0) - 2019-04-03

## Added

* Add support for Kubernetes 1.14
* Add support for upgrading from Kubernetes 1.13 to 1.14
* Add support for Google Compute Engine ([#307](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/307), [#317](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/317))
* Update machine-controller when upgrading the cluster ([#304](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/304))
* Add timeout after upgrading each node to let nodes to settle down ([#316](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/316), [#319](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/319))

## Changed

* Deploy machine-controller v1.1.2 on the new clusters ([#317](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/317))
* Creating MachineDeployments and upgrading nodes tasks are repeated three times on the failure ([#328](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/328))

# [v0.4.0](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/releases/tag/v0.4.0) - 2019-03-21

## Action Required

* In [#264](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/264) the environment variable names were changed to match names used by Terraform. In order for KubeOne to correctly fetch credentials you need to use the following variables:
  * `DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN` instead of `DO_TOKEN`
  * `OS_USERNAME` instead of `OS_USER_NAME`
  * `HCLOUD_TOKEN` instead of `HZ_TOKEN`
* The `cloud-config` file is now required for OpenStack clusters. Validation will fail if the `cloud-config` is not provided. See the [OpenStack quickstart](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/blob/v0.4.0/docs/quickstart-openstack.md) for details how the `cloud-config` file should look like.
* Ark integration is removed from KubeOne in [#265](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/265). You need to remove the `backups` section from the existing configuration files. If you wish to deploy Ark on new clusters you have to do it manually.

## Added

* Add support for enabling DynamicAuditing ([#261](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/261))

## Changed

* Deploy machine-controller v1.0.7 on the new clusters ([#247](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/247))
* Automatically download the Kubeconfing file after install ([#248](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/248))
* Default `--destory-workers` to `true` for the `kubeone reset` command ([#252](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/252))
* Improve OpenStack Terraform scripts ([#253](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/253))
* The `cloud-config` file for OpenStack is required ([#253](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/253))
* The environment variable names are changed to match names used by Terraform ([#264](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/264))

## Removed

* Option for deploying Ark is removed ([#265](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/265))

# [v0.3.0](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/releases/tag/v0.3.0) - 2019-03-08

## Action Required

* If you're using `provider.Name` `external` to configure control plane nodes to work with external CCM you need to:
    * Set `provider.Name` to name of the cloud provider you're using or to `none` (see [`config.yaml.dist`](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/blob/v0.3.0/config.yaml.dist) for supported values),
    * Set `provider.External` to `true`.
    * **Note: using external CCM is not supported and is currently not working as expected.**
* If you're using `provider.Name` `none`:
    * If you're deploying `machine-controller` you need to set `MachineController.Provider` to name of the cloud provider you're using for worker nodes,
    * Otherwise you need to set `MachineController.Deploy` to `false`, so validation passes.

## Added

* Add support for cluster upgrades ([#206](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/206), [#211](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/211), [#214](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/214))
* Add support for enabling PodSecurityPolicy ([#218](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/218))
* Add `kubeone version` command ([#221](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/221))
* Add initial support for OpenStack worker nodes ([#209](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/209))

## Changed

* Fix `none` provider bugs and ensure correct behavior ([#227](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/227))
* External Cloud Controller Manager is now enabled by setting `Provider.External` to `true` instead of setting `Provider.Name` to `external` ([#230](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/230), [#237](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/237))
* Set correct Internal address on nodes with 2+ network interfaces ([#240](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/240))
* Deploy `machine-controller` on uninitialized nodes ([#241](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/241))

# [v0.2.0](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/releases/tag/v0.2.0) - 2019-02-15

* Add support for external cloud controller managers ([#161](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/161))
* Add Terraform scripts for OpenStack ([#170](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/170))
* Add support for configuring proxy for Docker daemon, `apt-get`/`yum` and `curl` ([#182](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/182))

## Changed

* AWS credentials can be obtained from the profile file ([#156](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/156))
* Fix Etcd init on clusters with more than one network interface ([#160](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/160))
* Allow `provider.Name` to be specified for providers without external Cloud Controller Manager ([#161](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/161))
* Refactor KubeOne CLI ([#177](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/177))
    * Global flags are parsed correctly regardless of their placement in the command
    * `--verbose` and `--tfjson` are global flags
    * The main package is moved to the root of project (`github.com/kubermatic/kubeone`)
* Deploy `machine-controller` v1.0.4 instead of v0.10.0 to fix CVE-2019-5736 ([#191](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/191))
* Deploy Docker 18.09.2 on Ubuntu to fix CVE-2019-5736 ([#193](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/193))
