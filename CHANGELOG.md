# [v1.4.2](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/releases/tag/v1.4.2) - 2022-04-26

## Attention Needed

This patch releases updates etcd to v3.5.3 which includes a fix for the data inconsistency issues reported earlier (https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/B7gJs88XtQc/m/rSgNOzV2BwAJ). To upgrade etcd for an existing cluster, you need to [force upgrade the cluster as described here](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubeone/v1.4/guides/etcd_corruption/#enabling-etcd-corruption-checks). If you're running Kubernetes 1.22 or newer, we strongly recommend upgrading etcd **as soon as possible**.

# [v1.4.1](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/releases/tag/v1.4.1) - 2022-04-04

## Attention Needed

This patch release enables the etcd corruption checks on every etcd member that is running etcd 3.5 (which applies to all Kubernetes 1.22+ clusters). This change is a [recommendation from the etcd maintainers](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/B7gJs88XtQc/m/rSgNOzV2BwAJ) due to issues in etcd 3.5 that can cause data consistency issues. The changes in this patch release will prevent corrupted etcd members from joining or staying in the etcd ring.

# [v1.4.0](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/releases/tag/v1.4.0) - 2022-02-16

## Attention Needed

Check out the [Upgrading from 1.3 to 1.4 tutorial](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubeone/v1.4/tutorials/upgrading/upgrading_from_1.3_to_1.4/) for more details about the breaking changes and how to mitigate them.

* KubeOne 1.4.0-beta.0 introduces the new KubeOneCluster v1beta2 API
  * The existing KubeOneCluster v1beta1 manifests can be migrated by using the `kubeone config migrate` command
  * The `kubeone config print` command now uses the new v1beta2 API
  * The existing KubeOneCluster v1beta1 API is considered deprecated and will be removed in KubeOne 1.6+
  * Highlights:
    * The API group has been changed from `kubeone.io` to `kubeone.k8c.io`
    * The AssetConfiguration API has been removed from the v1beta2 API. The AssetConfiguration API can still be used with the v1beta1 API, but we highly recommend migrating away because the v1beta1 API is deprecated
    * The PodPresets feature has been removed from the v1beta2 API because Kubernetes removed support for PodPresets in Kubernetes 1.20
    * Packet (`packet`) cloud provider has been rebranded to Equinix Metal (`equinixmetal`). The existing Packet cluster will work with `equinixmetal` cloud provider, however, [manual migration steps](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubeone/v1.4/tutorials/upgrading/upgrading_from_1.3_to_1.4/#packet-to-equinix-metal-rebranding) are required if you want to use new Terraform configs for Equinix Metal
    * A new ContainerRuntime API has been added to the v1beta2 API in order to support configuring mirror registries
* `kubeone install` and `kubeone upgrade` commands are considered deprecated in favor of `kubeone apply`
  * `install` and `upgrade` commands will be removed in KubeOne 1.6+
  * We highly encourage switching to `kubeone apply`. The `apply` command has the same semantics and works in the same way as `install`/`upgrade`, with some additional checks to ensure each requested operation is safe for the cluster
* Unconditionally deploy AWS, AzureDisk, AzureFile, and vSphere CSI drivers if the Kubernetes version is 1.23 or newer ([#1831](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1831))
  * Those providers have the CSI migration enabled by default in Kubernetes 1.23, so the CSI driver will be used for all volumes operations
* Unconditionally deploy DigitalOcean, Hetzner, Nutanix, and OpenStack Cinder CSI drivers ([#1831](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1831))
  * OpenStack has the CSI migration enabled by default since Kubernetes 1.18, so the CSI driver will be used for all operations
* CentOS 8 has reached End-Of-Life (EOL) on January 31st, 2022. It will no longer receive any updates (including security updates). Support for CentOS 8 in KubeOne is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. We strongly recommend migrating to another operating system or RHEL/CentOS distribution as soon as possible.

### Breaking changes / Action Required

* The default AMI for CentOS in Terraform configs for AWS has been changed to Rocky Linux. If you use the new Terraform configs with an existing cluster, make sure to bind the AMI as described in [the production recommendations document](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubeone/master/cheat_sheets/production_recommendations/) ([#1809](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1809))
* The `cloud-provider-credentials` Secret is removed by KubeOne because KubeOne does not use it any longer. If you have any workloads **NOT** created by KubeOne that use this Secret, please migrate before upgrading KubeOne. Instead, KubeOne now creates `kubeone-machine-controller-credentials` and `kubeone-ccm-credentials` Secrets used by machine-controller and external CCM
* Support for Amazon EKS-D clusters has been removed starting from this release
* GCP: Default operating system for control plane instances is now Ubuntu 20.04 ([#1576](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1576))
  * Make sure to bind `control_plane_image_family` to the image you're currently using or Terraform might recreate all your control plane instances
* Azure: Default VM type is changed to `Standard_F2` ([#1528](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1528))
  * Make sure to bind `control_plane_vm_size` and `worker_vm_size` to the VM size you're currently using or Terraform might recreate all your instances

## Known Issues

* It's not possible to run kube-proxy in IPVS mode on Kubernetes 1.23 clusters using Canal/Calico CNI. Trying to upgrade existing 1.22 clusters using IPVS to 1.23 will result in a validation error from KubeOne

## Added

## Changed

### General

* Increase the minimum Kubernetes version to 1.20 ([#1818](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1818))
* Validate the Kubernetes version against supported versions constraints ([#1808](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1808))
* Allow Docker as a container runtime up to Kubernetes v1.24 (previously up to v1.22) ([#1826](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1826))

* **[BREAKING]** The `cloud-provider-credentials` Secret is removed by KubeOne because KubeOne does not use it any longer. If you have any workloads NOT created by KubeOne that use this Secret, please migrate before upgrading KubeOne. Instead, KubeOne now creates `kubeone-machine-controller-credentials` and `kubeone-ccm-credentials` Secrets used by machine-controller and external CCM ([#1717](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1717), [#1718](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1718))
* Unconditionally deploy AWS, AzureDisk, AzureFile, and vSphere CSI drivers if the Kubernetes version is 1.23 or newer ([#1831](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1831))
  * Those providers have the CSI migration enabled by default in Kubernetes 1.23, so the CSI driver will be used for all volumes operations
* Unconditionally deploy DigitalOcean, Hetzner, Nutanix, and OpenStack Cinder CSI drivers ([#1831](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1831))

  * This fixes the issue causing machine-controller and machine-controller-webhook deployments to run with incorrect flags
  * If you created your cluster with KubeOne 1.2 or older, and already upgraded to KubeOne 1.3, we recommend running kubeone apply again with KubeOne 1.3.2 or newer to properly reconcile machine-controller deployments
* Fix `yum versionlock delete containerd.io` error ([#1600](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1600))

* Fix control plane tolerations in Azure CCM and CSI addons (`node-role.kubernetes.io/master` doesn't have a value) ([#1733](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1733))
* Add node affinity to the cluster-autoscaler addon ([#1716](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1716))
* Update the cluster-autoscaler addon to match the upstream manifest ([#1713](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1713))

* Default image in the cluster-autoscaler addon and allow the image to be overridden using addon parameters ([#1552](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1552))
* Minor improvements to OpenStack CCM and CSI addons. OpenStack CSI controller can now be scheduled on control plane nodes ([#1531](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1531))
* Deploy default StorageClass for GCP clusters if the `default-storage-class` addon is enabled ([#1638](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1638))
* Deploy the StorageClass based on the CSI driver if the CSI driver is deployed (requires the `default-storage-class` addon to be enabled) ([#1853](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1853))
* Always deploy the StorageClass based on the in-tee provider (requires the `default-storage-class` addon to be enabled). This StorageClass will use the CSI driver if the CSI migration is enabled (default for all providers if the Kubernetes version is >= 1.23 or if the external CCM is used) ([#1853](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1853))

### Terraform Configs

* **[BREAKING]** GCP: Default operating system for control plane instances is now Ubuntu 20.04 ([#1576](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1576))
  * Make sure to bind `control_plane_image_family` to the image you're currently using or Terraform might recreate all your control plane instances

# [v1.4.0-beta.1](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/releases/tag/v1.4.0-beta.1) - 2022-01-14

## Attention Needed

* **[BREAKING]** The `cloud-provider-credentials` Secret is removed by KubeOne because KubeOne does not use it any longer. If you have any workloads NOT created by KubeOne that use this Secret, please migrate before upgrading KubeOne. Instead, KubeOne now creates `kubeone-machine-controller-credentials` and `kubeone-ccm-credentials` Secrets used by machine-controller and external CCM ([#1717](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1717), [#1718](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1718))

## Added

* Add experimental/alpha support for Nutanix ([#1723](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1723), [#1725](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1725), [#1733](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1733))
  * Support for Nutanix is experimental, so implementation and relevant addons might be changed until it doesn't graduate to beta/stable
* Add the Nutanix CSI driver addon. The addon is deployed manually, on-demand, by enabling the `csi-nutanix` embedded addon (see the PR description for more details and examples) ([#1733](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1733), [#1734](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1734))
* Add the default StorageClass for the Nutanix CSI driver. The StorageClass can be deployed by enabling the `default-storage-class` embedded addon (see the PR description for more details and examples) ([#1733](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1733))
* Add the Registry Credentials configuration to the RegistryConfiguration API ([#1724](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1724))
* Add support for different credentials for machine-controller and CCM. Environment variables can be prefixed with `MC_` for machine-controller credentials and `CCM_` for CCM credentials ([#1717](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1717))

## Changed

### General

* **[BREAKING]** The `cloud-provider-credentials` Secret is removed by KubeOne because KubeOne does not use it any longer. If you have any workloads NOT created by KubeOne that use this Secret, please migrate before upgrading KubeOne. Instead, KubeOne now creates `kubeone-machine-controller-credentials` and `kubeone-ccm-credentials` Secrets used by machine-controller and external CCM ([#1717](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1717), [#1718](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1718))

### Fixed

* Fix a bug with the addons applier applying all files when the addons path is not provided ([#1733](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1733))

### Addons

* Fix control plane tolerations in Azure CCM and CSI addons (`node-role.kubernetes.io/master` doesn't have a value) ([#1733](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1733))
* Add node affinity to the cluster-autoscaler addon ([#1716](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1716))

### Terraform Configs

* Remove `centos` choice from the GCE Terraform example configs as it's unsupported ([#1712](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1712))

### Updated

* Update machine-controller to v1.42.0 ([#1733](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1733))

# [v1.4.0-beta.0](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/releases/tag/v1.4.0-beta.0) - 2022-01-04

## Attention Needed

* KubeOne 1.4.0-beta.0 introduces the new KubeOneCluster v1beta2 API
  * The new v1beta2 API is still under-development and might be changed before the KubeOne 1.4.0 release
  * We recommend and highly encourage testing the new API, but considering that the API might be changed before the final release, we don't recommend migrating production clusters to the new API yet
  * The migration for existing KubeOneCluster manifests is not yet available
  * The `kubeone config print` command now uses the new v1beta2 API
  * The existing KubeOneCluster v1beta1 API is considered as deprecated and will be removed in KubeOne 1.6+
  * Highlights:
    * The API group has been changed from `kubeone.io` to `kubeone.k8c.io`
    * The AssetConfiguration API has been removed from the v1beta2 API. The AssetConfiguration API can still be used with the v1beta1 API, but we highly recommend migrating away because the v1beta1 API is deprecated
    * The PodPresets feature has been removed from the v1beta2 API because Kubernetes removed support for PodPresets in Kubernetes 1.20
    * Packet (`packet`) cloud provider has been rebranded to Equinix Metal (`equinixmetal`). The existing Packet cluster will work with `equinixmetal` cloud provider, however, manual migration steps are required if you want to use new Terraform configs for Equinix Metal
    * A new ContainerRuntime API has been added to the v1beta2 API in order to support configuring mirror registries. This API is still work-in-progress and will mostly like be extended before the final release
* `kubeone install` and `kubeone upgrade` commands are considered as deprecated in favor of `kubeone apply`
  * `install` and `upgrade` commands will be removed in KubeOne 1.6+
  * We highly encourage switching to `kubeone apply`. The `apply` command has the same semantics and works in the same way as `install`/`upgrade`, with some additional checks to ensure each requested operation is safe for the cluster
* Support for Amazon EKS-D clusters has been removed starting from this release

## Known Issues

* It's not possible to run kube-proxy in IPVS mode on Kubernetes 1.23 clusters using Canal/Calico CNI. Trying to upgrade existing 1.22 clusters using IPVS to 1.23 will result in a validation error from KubeOne
  * More information about this issue can be found in the following Calico ticket: https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/issues/5011

## Added

# [v1.3.5](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/releases/tag/v1.3.5) - 2022-04-26

## Attention Needed

This patch releases updates etcd to v3.5.3 which includes a fix for the data inconsistency issues reported earlier (https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/B7gJs88XtQc/m/rSgNOzV2BwAJ). To upgrade etcd for an existing cluster, you need to [force upgrade the cluster as described here](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubeone/v1.4/guides/etcd_corruption/#enabling-etcd-corruption-checks). If you're running Kubernetes 1.22 or newer, we strongly recommend upgrading etcd **as soon as possible**.

## Updated

- Upgrade machine-controller to v1.37.3 ([#1984](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1984))
  - This fixes an issue where the machine-controller would not wait for the volumeAttachments deletion before deleting the node.
- Deploy etcd v3.5.3 for clusters running Kubernetes 1.22 or newer. etcd v3.5.3 includes a fix for [the data inconsistency issues announced by the etcd maintainers](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/B7gJs88XtQc/m/rSgNOzV2BwAJ. To upgrade etcd) for an existing cluster, you need to [force upgrade the cluster as described here](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubeone/v1.4/guides/etcd_corruption/#enabling-etcd-corruption-checks) ([#1953](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1953))

# [v1.3.4](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/releases/tag/v1.3.4) - 2022-04-05

## Attention Needed

This patch release enables the etcd corruption checks on every etcd member that is running etcd 3.5 (which applies to all Kubernetes 1.22+ clusters). This change is a [recommendation from the etcd maintainers](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/B7gJs88XtQc/m/rSgNOzV2BwAJ) due to issues in etcd 3.5 that can cause data consistency issues. The changes in this patch release will prevent corrupted etcd members from joining or staying in the etcd ring.

## Changed

* Enable the etcd integrity checks (on startup and every 4 hours) for Kubernetes 1.22+ clusters. See [the official etcd announcement for more details](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/B7gJs88XtQc/m/rSgNOzV2BwAJ). ([#1928](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1928))
* Validate Kubernetes version against supported versions constraints. The minimum supported version is 1.19, and the maximum supported version is 1.22 ([#1817](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1817))
* Fix AMI filter in Terraform configs for AWS to always use `x86_64` images ([#1692](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1692))

# [v1.3.3](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/releases/tag/v1.3.3) - 2021-12-16

## Changed

### Fixed

* Allow pods with the seccomp profile defined to get scheduled if the PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) feature is enabled ([#1687](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1687))
* Fix the image loader script to support KubeOne 1.3+ and Kubernetes 1.22+ ([#1672](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1672))
* The `kubeone config images` command now shows images for the latest Kubernetes version (instead of for the oldest) ([#1672](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1672))
* Add a new `--kubernetes-version` flag to the `kubeone config images` command ([#1672](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1672))
  * This flag is used to filter images for a particular Kubernetes version. The flag cannot be used along with the KubeOneCluster manifest (`--manifest` flag)

### Addons

* Deploy default StorageClass for GCP clusters if the `default-storage-class` addon is enabled ([#1639](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1639))

### Updated

* Update machine-controller to v1.37.2 ([#1654](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1654))
  * machine-controller is now using Ubuntu 20.04 instead of 18.04 by default for all newly-created Machines on AWS, Azure, DO, GCE, Hetzner, Openstack, and Equinix Metal
  * This release defaults the provisioning utility for Flatcar machines on AWS to cloud-init (previously ignition). Ignition is currently not working on AWS because of the user data limit
  * If you have the provisioning utility explicitly set to Ignition, you'll not be able to provision new Flatcar machines on AWS. In that case, manually changing the provisioning utility to cloud-init is required

# [v1.3.2](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/releases/tag/v1.3.2) - 2021-11-18

# [v1.3.1](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/releases/tag/v1.3.1) - unreleased

**The v1.3.1 release has never been released due to an issue with the release process. Please check the [v1.3.2 release](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/releases/tag/v1.3.2) instead.**

# [v1.3.0](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/releases/tag/v1.3.0) - 2021-09-15

## Attention Needed

Check out the [Upgrading from 1.2 to 1.3 tutorial](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubeone/v1.3/tutorials/upgrading/upgrading_from_1.2_to_1.3/) for more details about the breaking changes and how to mitigate them.

### Breaking changes / Action Required

* Increase the minimum Kubernetes version to v1.19.0. If you have Kubernetes clusters running v1.18 or older, you need to use an older KubeOne release to upgrade them to v1.19, and then upgrade to KubeOne 1.3.
* Increase the minimum Terraform version to 1.0.0.
* Remove support for Debian and RHEL 7 clusters. If you have Debian clusters, we recommend migrating to another operating system, for example Ubuntu. If you have RHEL 7 clusters, you should consider migrating to RHEL 8 which is supported.
* Automatically deploy CSI plugins for Hetzner, OpenStack, and vSphere clusters using external cloud provider. If you already have the CSI plugin deployed, you need to make sure that your CSI plugin deployment is compatible with the KubeOne CSI plugin addon.
* The `kubeone reset` command requires an explicit confirmation like the `apply` command starting with this release. The command can be automatically approved by using the `--auto-approve` flag.

### Deprecations

* KubeOne Addons can now be organized into subdirectories. It currently remains possible to put addons in the root of the addons directory, however, this is option is considered as deprecated as of this release. We highly recommend all users to reorganize their addons into subdirectories, where each subdirectory is for YAML manifests related to one addon.
* We're deprecating support for CentOS 8 because it's reaching [End-of-Life (EOL) on December 31, 2021](https://www.centos.org/centos-linux-eol/). CentOS 7 remains supported by KubeOne for now.

## Known Issues

* It's currently **not** possible to provision or upgrade to Kubernetes 1.22 for clusters running on vSphere. This is because vSphere CCM and CSI don't support Kubernetes 1.22. We'll introduce Kubernetes 1.22 support for vSphere as soon as new CCM and CSI releases with support for Kubernetes 1.22 are out.
* Newly-provisioned Kubernetes 1.22 clusters or clusters upgraded from Kubernetes 1.21 to 1.22 using KubeOne 1.3.0-alpha.1  use a metrics-server version incompatible with Kubernetes 1.22. This might cause issues with deleting Namespaces that manifests by the Namespace being stuck in the Terminating state. This can be fixed by upgrading KubeOne to v1.3.0-rc.0 or newer and running `kubeone apply`.
* The new Addons API requires the addons directory path (`.addons.path`) to be provided and the directory must exist (it can be empty), even if only embedded addons are used. If the path is not provided, it'll default to `./addons`.

## Added

### API

* Implement the Addons API used to manage addons deployed by KubeOne. The new Addons API can be used to deploy the addons embedded in the KubeOne binary. Currently available addons are: `backups-restic`, `cluster-autoscaler`, `default-storage-class`, and `unattended-upgrades` ([#1462](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1462), [#1486](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1486))
  * More information about the new API can be found in the [Addons documentation](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubeone/v1.3/guides/addons/) or by running `kubeone config print --full`.
* Add support for specifying a custom Root CA bundle ([#1316](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1316))
* Add new kube-proxy configuration API ([#1420](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1420))
  * This API allows users to switch kube-proxy to IPVS mode, and configure IPVS properties such as strict ARP and scheduler
  * The default kube-proxy mode remains iptables

* Add a new KubeOne addon for handling unattended upgrades of the operating system ([#1291](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1291))

## Changed

### General

* Increase the minimum Kubernetes version to v1.19.0. If you have Kubernetes clusters running v1.18 or older, you need to use an older KubeOne release to upgrade them to v1.19, and then upgrade to KubeOne 1.3.

### CLI

* Ignore preexisting static manifests kubeadm preflight error ([#1335](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1335))

### Updated

* Upgrade Terraform to 1.0.0. The minimum Terraform version as of this KubeOne release is v1.0.0. ([#1368](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1368), [#1376](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1376))
* Use latest available (wildcard) docker and containerd version ([#1358](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1358))
* Update machine-controller to v1.35.2 ([#1489](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1489))
* Update metrics-server to v0.5.0. This fixes support for Kubernetes 1.22 clusters ([#1483](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1483))
  * The metrics-server now uses serving certificates signed by the Kubernetes CA instead of the self-signed certificates.
* OpenStack CCM version now depends on the Kubernetes version ([#1465](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1465))

## Removed

* Remove CSIMigration and CSIMigrationComplete fields from the API ([#1473](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1473))
  * Those two fields were non-functional since they were added, so this change shouldn't affect users.
  * If you have any of those those two fields set in the KubeOneCluster manifest, make sure to remove them or otherwise the validation will fail.
* Remove CNI patching ([#1386](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1386))

# [v1.3.0-rc.0](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/releases/tag/v1.3.0-rc.0) - 2021-09-06

## Attention Needed

* [**BREAKING/ACTION REQUIRED**] Increase the minimum Kubernetes version to v1.19.0 ([#1466](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1466))
  * If you have Kubernetes clusters running v1.18 or older, you need to use an older KubeOne release to upgrade them to v1.19, and then upgrade to KubeOne 1.3.
  * Check out the [Compatibility guide](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubeone/master/architecture/compatibility/) for more information about supported Kubernetes versions for each KubeOne release.
* [**BREAKING/ACTION REQUIRED**] Add support for CSI plugins for clusters using external cloud provider (i.e. `.cloudProvider.external` is enabled)
  * The Cinder CSI plugin is deployed by default for OpenStack clusters ([#1465](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1465))
  * The Hetzner CSI plugin is deployed by default for Hetzner clusters
  * The vSphere CSI plugin is deployed by default if the CSI plugin configuration is provided via newly-added  `cloudProvider.csiConfig` field
    * More information about the CSI plugin configuration can be found in the vSphere CSI docs: https://vsphere-csi-driver.sigs.k8s.io/driver-deployment/installation.html#create_csi_vsphereconf
    * Note: the vSphere CSI plugin requires vSphere version 6.7U3.
  * The default StorageClass is **not** deployed by default. It can be deployed via new Addons API by enabling the `default-storage-class` addon, or manually.
  * **ACTION REQUIRED**: If you already have the CSI plugin deployed, you need to make sure that your CSI plugin deployment is compatible with the KubeOne CSI plugin addon.
    * You can find the CSI addons in the `addons` directory: https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/tree/master/addons
    * If your CSI plugin deployment is incompatible with the KubeOne CSI addon, you can resolve it in one of the following ways:
      * Delete your CSI deployment and let KubeOne install the CSI driver for you. **Note**: you'll **not** be able to mount volumes until you don't install the CSI driver again.
      * Override the appropriate CSI addon with your deployment manifest. With this way, KubeOne will install the CSI plugin using your manifests. To do this, you need to:
        * Enable addons in the KubeOneCluster manifest (`.addons.enable`) and provide the path to addons directory (`.addons.path`, for example: `./addons`)
        * Create a subdirectory in the addons directory named same as the CSI addon used by KubeOne, for example `./addons/csi-openstack-cinder` or `./addons/csi-vsphere` (see https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/tree/master/addons for addon names)
        * Put your CSI deployment manifests in the newly created subdirectory

## Known Issues

* It's currently **not** possible to provision or upgrade to Kubernetes 1.22 for clusters running on vSphere. This is because vSphere CCM and CSI don't support Kubernetes 1.22. We'll introduce Kubernetes 1.22 support for vSphere as soon as new CCM and CSI releases with support for Kubernetes 1.22 are out.
* Clusters provisioned with Kubernetes 1.22 or upgraded from 1.21 to 1.22 using KubeOne 1.3.0-alpha.1 use a metrics-server version incompatible with Kubernetes 1.22. This might cause issues with deleting Namespaces that manifests by the Namespace being stuck in the Terminating state. This can be fixed by upgrading the metrics-server by running `kubeone apply`.
* The new Addons API requires the addons directory path (`.addons.path`) to be provided and the directory must exist (it can be empty), even if only embedded addons are used. If the path is not provided, it'll default to `./addons`.

## Added

### Features

* Implement the Addons API used to manage addons deployed by KubeOne ([#1462](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1462), [#1486](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1486))
  * The new Addons API can be used to deploy the addons embedded in the KubeOne binary.
  * Currently available addons are: `backups-restic`, `default-storage-class`, and `unattended-upgrades`.
  * More information about the new API can be found by running `kubeone config print --full`.
* [**BREAKING/ACTION REQUIRED**] Add support for the Cinder CSI plugin ([#1465](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1465))
  * The plugin is deployed by default for OpenStack clusters using the external cloud provider.
  * Check out the Attention Needed section of the changelog for more information.
* Add support for the vSphere CSI plugin ([#1484](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1484))
  * Deploying the CSI plugin requires providing the CSI configuration using a newly added `.cloudProvider.csiConfig` field
    * More information about the CSI plugin configuration can be found in the vSphere CSI docs: https://vsphere-csi-driver.sigs.k8s.io/driver-deployment/installation.html#create_csi_vsphereconf
  * The CSI plugin is deployed automatically if `.cloudProvider.csiConfig` is provided and `.cloudProvider.external` is enabled
  * Check out the Attention Needed section of the changelog for more information.
* Implement the CCM/CSI migration for OpenStack and vSphere ([#1468](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1468), [#1469](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1469), [#1472](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1472), [#1482](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1482), [#1487](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1487), [#1494](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1494))
  * The CCM/CSI migration is used to migrate clusters running in-tree cloud provider (i.e. with `.cloudProvider.external` set to `false`) to the external CCM (cloud-controller-manager) and CSI plugin.
  * The migration is implemented with the `kubeone migrate to-ccm-csi` command.
  * The CCM/CSI migration for vSphere is currently experimental and not tested.
  * More information about how the CCM/CSI migration works can be found by running `kubeone migrate to-ccm-csi --help`.

### Addons

* Add a new optional embedded addon `default-storage-class` used to deploy default StorageClass for AWS, Azure, GCP, OpenStack, vSphere, or Hetzner clusters ([#1488](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1488))

## Changed

### General

* [**BREAKING/ACTION REQUIRED**] Increase the minimum Kubernetes version to v1.19.0 ([#1466](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1466))
  * If you have Kubernetes clusters running v1.18 or older, you need to use an older KubeOne release to upgrade them to v1.19, and then upgrade to KubeOne 1.3.
  * Check out the [Compatibility guide](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubeone/master/architecture/compatibility/) for more information about supported Kubernetes versions for each KubeOne release.
* Improve the `kubeone reset` output to include more information about the target cluster ([#1474](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1474))

### Fixed

* Make `kubeone apply` skip already provisioned static worker nodes ([#1485](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1485))
* Fix NPE when migrating to containerd ([#1499](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1499))

### Updated

* OpenStack CCM version now depends on the Kubernetes version ([#1465](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1465))
  * Kubernetes 1.19 clusters use OpenStack CCM v1.19.2
  * Kubernetes 1.20 clusters use OpenStack CCM v1.20.2
  * Kubernetes 1.21 clusters use OpenStack CCM v1.21.0
  * Kubernetes 1.22+ clusters use OpenStack CCM v1.22.0
* vSphere CCM (CPI) version now depends on the Kubernetes version ([#1489](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1489))
  * Kubernetes 1.19 clusters use vSphere CPI v1.19.0
  * Kubernetes 1.20 clusters use vSphere CPI v1.20.0
  * Kubernetes 1.21 clusters use vSphere CPI v1.21.0
  * Kubernetes 1.22+ clusters are currently unsupported on vSphere (see Known Issues for more details)
* Update metrics-server to v0.5.0 ([#1483](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1483))
  * This fixes support for Kubernetes 1.22 clusters.
  * The metrics-server now uses serving certificates signed by the Kubernetes CA instead of the self-signed certificates.
* Update machine-controller to v1.35.2 ([#1489](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1489))
* Update Hetzner CSI driver to v1.6.0 ([#1491](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1491))

## Removed

* Remove CSIMigration and CSIMigrationComplete fields from the API ([#1473](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1473))
  * Those two fields were non-functional since they were added, so this change shouldn't affect users.
  * If you have any of those those two fields set in the KubeOneCluster manifest, make sure to remove them or otherwise the validation will fail.

# [v1.3.0-alpha.1](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/releases/tag/v1.3.0-alpha.1) - 2021-08-18

## Known Issues

* Clusters provisioned with Kubernetes 1.22 or upgraded from 1.21 to 1.22 using KubeOne 1.3.0-alpha.1 use a metrics-server version incompatible with Kubernetes 1.22. This might cause issues with deleting Namespaces that manifests by the Namespace being stuck in the Terminating state. This can be fixed by upgrading to KubeOne 1.3.0-rc.0 and running `kubeone apply`.

## Added

* Add support for Kubernetes 1.22 ([#1447](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1447), [#1456](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1456))
* Add support for the kubeadm v1beta3 API. The kubeadm v1beta3 API is used for all Kubernetes 1.22+ clusters. ([#1457](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1457))

## Changed

### Fixed

* Fix adding second container to the machine-controller-webhook Deployment ([#1433](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1433))
* Extend restart API server script to handle failing `crictl logs` due to missing symlink. This fixes the issue with `kubeone apply` failing to restart the API server containers when provisioning or upgrading the cluster ([#1448](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1448))

### Updated

* Update Go to 1.16.7 ([#1441](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1441))
* Update machine-controller to v1.35.1 ([#1440](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1440))

  * Add `HCLOUD_LOAD_BALANCERS_USE_PRIVATE_IP=true` to the environment if the network is configured
* Update DigitalOcean CCM to v0.1.33 ([#1429](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1429))

### Terraform Configs

* Inherit the firmware settings from the template VM in the Terraform configs for vSphere ([#1445](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1445))

# [v1.3.0-alpha.0](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/releases/tag/v1.3.0-alpha.0) - 2021-07-21

## Attention Needed

* [**BREAKING/ACTION REQUIRED**] The `kubeone reset` command requires an explicit confirmation like the `apply` command starting with this release
  * Running the `reset` command requires typing `yes` to confirm the intention to unprovision/reset the cluster
  * The command can be automatically approved by using the `--auto-approve` flag
* [**BREAKING/ACTION REQUIRED**] Upgrade Terraform to 1.0.0. The minimum Terraform version as of this KubeOne release is v1.0.0. ([#1368](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1368))
* [**BREAKING/ACTION REQUIRED**] Use AdmissionRegistration v1 API for machine-controller-webhook. The minimum supported Kubernetes version is now 1.16. ([#1290](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1290))
  * Since AdmissionRegistartion v1 got introduced in Kubernetes 1.16, the minimum Kubernetes version that can be managed by KubeOne is now 1.16. If you're running the Kubernetes clusters running 1.15 or older, please use the older release of KubeOne to upgrade those clusters
* KubeOne Addons can now be organized into subdirectories. It currently remains possible to put addons in the root of the addons directory, however, this is option is considered as deprecated as of this release. We highly recommend all users to reorganize their addons into subdirectories, where each subdirectory is for YAML manifests related to one addon.

## Added

### API

* Add new kube-proxy configuration API ([#1420](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1420))
  * This API allows users to switch kube-proxy to IPVS mode, and configure IPVS properties such as strict ARP and scheduler
  * The default kube-proxy mode remains iptables
* Add support for Encryption Providers ([#1241](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1241), [#1320](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1320))

# [v1.2.3](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/releases/tag/v1.2.3) - 2021-06-14

## Changed

### Bug Fixes

* Pass the `-node-external-cloud-provider` flag to the machine-controller-webhook. This fixes the issue with the worker nodes not using the external CCM on the clusters with the external CCM enabled ([#1380](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1380))
* Disable `repo_gpgcheck` for the Kubernetes yum repository. This fixes the cluster provisioning and upgrading failures for CentOS/RHEL caused by yum failing to install Kubernetes packages ([#1304](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1304))

## Changed

### Bug Fixes

* Fix AWS config for terraform 0.15 ([#1372](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1372))
  * AWS terraform config now works under terraform 0.15+ (including 1.0)
* Update machinecontroller to v1.30.0 ([#1370](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1370))
  * machinecontroller to v1.30.0 relaxes docker / containerd version constraints
* Relax docker/containerd version constraints ([#1371](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1371))

# [v1.2.1](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/releases/tag/v1.2.1) - 2021-03-23

**Check out the changelog for the [v1.2.1 release](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/releases/tag/v1.2.1) for more information about what changes were introduced in the 1.2 release.**

## Changed

### Bug Fixes

* Install `cri-tools` (`crictl`) on Amazon Linux 2. This fixes the issue with provisioning Kubernetes and Amazon EKS-D clusters on Amazon Linux 2 ([#1282](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1282))

# [v1.2.0](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/releases/tag/v1.2.0) - 2021-03-18

## Attention Needed

* [**BREAKING/ACTION REQUIRED**] Starting with the KubeOne 1.3 release, the `kubeone reset` command will require an explicit confirmation like the `apply` command
  * Running the `reset` command will require typing `yes` to confirm the intention to unprovision/reset the cluster
  * The command can be automatically approved by using the `--auto-approve` flag
  * The `--auto-approve` flag has been already implemented as a no-op flag in this release
  * Starting with this release, running `kubeone reset` will show a warning about this change each time the `reset` command is used
* [**BREAKING/ACTION REQUIRED**] Disallow and deprecate the PodPresets feature
  * If you're upgrading a cluster that uses the PodPresets feature from Kubernetes 1.19 to 1.20, you have to disable the PodPresets feature in the KubeOne configuration manifest
  * The PodPresets feature has been removed from Kubernetes 1.20 with no built-in replacement
  * It's not possible to use the PodPresets feature starting with Kubernetes 1.20, however, it currently remains possible to use it for older Kubernetes versions
  * The PodPresets feature will be removed from the KubeOneCluster API once Kubernetes 1.19 reaches End-of-Life (EOL)
  * As an alternative to the PodPresets feature, Kubernetes recommends using the MutatingAdmissionWebhooks.
* [**BREAKING/ACTION REQUIRED**] Support for CoreOS has been removed from KubeOne and machine-controller
  * CoreOS has reached End-of-Life on May 26, 2020
  * As an alternative to CoreOS, KubeOne supports Flatcar Linux
  * We recommend migrating your CoreOS clusters to the Flatcar Linux or other supported operating system
* [**BREAKING/ACTION REQUIRED**] Default values for OpenIDConnect has been corrected to match what's advised by the example configuration
  * Previously, there were no default values for the OpenIDConnect fields
  * This might only affect users using the OpenIDConnect feature
* Kubernetes has announced deprecation of the Docker (dockershim) support in
  the Kubernetes 1.20 release. It's expected that Docker support will be
  removed in Kubernetes 1.22
  * All newly created clusters running Kubernetes 1.21+ will be provisioned
    with containerd instead of Docker
  * Automated migration from Docker to containerd is currently not available,
    but is planned for one of the upcoming KubeOne releases
  * We highly recommend using containerd instead of Docker for all newly
    created clusters. You can opt-in to use containerd instead of Docker by
    adding `containerRuntime` configuration to your KubeOne configuration
    manifest:
    ```yaml
    containerRuntime:
      containerd: {}
    ```
    For the configuration file reference, run `kubeone config print --full`.

## Known Issues

* Provisioning a Kubernetes or Amazon EKS-D cluster on Amazon Linux 2 will fail due to missing `crictl` binary. This bug has been fixed in the [v1.2.1 release](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/releases/tag/v1.2.1).
* Upgrading an Amazon EKS-D cluster will fail due to kubeadm preflight checks failing. We're investigating the issue and you can follow the progress by checking the issue [#1284](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/issues/1284).

## Added

* Add support for Kubernetes 1.20
* Add support for containerd container runtime ([#1180](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1180), [#1188](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1188), [#1190](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1190), [#1205](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1205), [#1227](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1227), [#1229](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1229))
  * Kubernetes has announced deprecation of the Docker (dockershim) support in
    the Kubernetes 1.20 release. It's expected that Docker support will be
    removed in Kubernetes 1.22 or 1.23
  * All newly created clusters running Kubernetes 1.21+ will use
    containerd instead of Docker by default
  * Automated migration from Docker to containerd for existing clusters is
    currently not available, but is planned for one of the upcoming KubeOne
    releases
* Add support for Debian on control plane and static worker nodes ([#1233](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1233))
  * Debian is currently not supported by machine-controller, so it's not
    possible to use it on worker nodes managed by Kubermatic machine-controller
* Add alpha-level support for Amazon Linux 2 ([#1167](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1167), [#1173](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1173), [#1175](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1175), [#1176](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1176))
  * Currently, all Kubernetes packages are installed by downloading binaries instead of using packages. Therefore, users are required to provide URLs using the new AssetConfiguration API to the CNI tarball, the Kubernetes Node binaries tarball (can be found in the Kubernetes CHANGELOG), and to the kubectl binary. Support for package managers is planned for the future.
* Add alpha-level AssetConfiguration API ([#1170](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1170), [#1171](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1171))
  * The AssetConfiguration API controls how assets are pulled
  * You can use it to specify custom images for containers or custom URLs for binaries
  * Currently-supported assets are CNI, Kubelet and Kubeadm (by providing a node binaries tarball), Kubectl, the control plane images, and the metrics-server image
  * Changing the binary assets (CNI, Kubelet, Kubeadm and Kubectl) currently works only on Amazon Linux 2. Changing the image assets works on all supported operating systems
* Add `Annotations` field to the `ProviderSpec` API used to add annotations to MachineDeployment objects ([#1174](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1174))
* Add support for defining Static Worker nodes in Terraform ([#1166](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1166))
* Add scrape Prometheus headless service for NodeLocalDNS ([#1165](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1165))

## Changed

### API Changes

* [**BREAKING/ACTION REQUIRED**] Default values for OpenIDConnect has been corrected to match what's advised by the example configuration ([#1235](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1235))
  * Previously, there were no default values for the OpenIDConnect fields
  * This might only affect users using the OpenIDConnect feature
* [**BREAKING/ACTION REQUIRED**] Disallow and deprecate the PodPresets feature ([#1236](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1236))
  * If you're upgrading a cluster that uses the PodPresets feature from Kubernetes 1.19 to 1.20, you have to disable the PodPresets feature in the KubeOne configuration manifest
  * The PodPresets feature has been removed from Kubernetes 1.20 with no built-in replacement
  * It's not possible to use the PodPresets feature starting with Kubernetes 1.20, however, it currently remains possible to use it for older Kubernetes versions
  * The PodPresets feature will be removed from the KubeOneCluster API once Kubernetes 1.19 reaches End-of-Life (EOL)
  * As an alternative to the PodPresets feature, Kubernetes recommends using the MutatingAdmissionWebhooks.

### General

* Warn about `kubeone reset` requiring explicit confirmation starting with KubeOne 1.3 ([#1252](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1252))
* Build KubeOne using Go 1.16.1 ([#1268](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1268), [#1267](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1267))
* Stop Kubelet and reload systemd when removing binaries on CoreOS/Flatcar ([#1176](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1176))
* Add rsync on CentOS and Amazon Linux ([#1240](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1240))

### Bug Fixes

* Drop mounting Flexvolume plugins into the OpenStack CCM. This fixes the issue with deploying the OpenStack CCM on the clusters running Flatcar Linux ([#1234](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1234))
* Ensure all credentials are available to be used in addons. This fixes the issue with the Backups addon not working on non-AWS providers ([#1248](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1248))
* Fix wrong legacy Docker version on RPM systems ([#1191](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1191))

## Attention Needed

* [**BREAKING/ACTION REQUIRED**] Starting with the KubeOne 1.3 release, the `kubeone reset` command will require an explicit confirmation like the `apply` command
  * Running the `reset` command will require typing `yes` to confirm the intention to unprovision/reset the cluster
  * The command can be automatically approved by using the `--auto-approve` flag
  * The `--auto-approve` flag has been already implemented as a no-op flag in this release
  * Starting with this release, running `kubeone reset` will show a warning about this change each time the `reset` command is used

## Added

* Add support for Kubernetes 1.20
  * Previously, we've shared that there is an issue affecting newly created clusters where the first control plane node is unhealthy/broken for the first 5-10 minutes. We've investigated the issue and found out that the issue can be successfully mitigated by restarting the first API server. We've implemented a task that automatically restarts the API server if it's affected by the issue ([#1243](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1243), [#1245](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1245))
* Add support for Debian on control plane and static worker nodes ([#1233](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1233))
  * Debian is currently not supported by machine-controller, so it's not possible to use it on worker nodes managed by machine-controller

# [v1.2.0-beta.0](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/releases/tag/v1.2.0-beta.0) - 2021-01-27

## Attention Needed

* Kubernetes has announced deprecation of the Docker (dockershim) support in
  the Kubernetes 1.20 release. It's expected that Docker support will be
  removed in Kubernetes 1.22
  * All newly created clusters running Kubernetes 1.21+ will be provisioned
    with containerd instead of Docker
  * Automated migration from Docker to containerd is currently not available,
    but is planned for one of the upcoming KubeOne releases
  * We highly recommend using containerd instead of Docker for all newly
    created clusters. You can opt-in to use containerd instead of Docker by
    adding `containerRuntime` configuration to your KubeOne configuration
    manifest:
    ```yaml
    containerRuntime:
      containerd: {}
    ```
    For the configuration file reference, run `kubeone config print --full`.


## Known Issues

* Provisioning Kubernetes 1.20 clusters results with one of the control plane
  nodes being unhealthy/broken for the first 5-10 minutes after provisioning
  the cluster. This causes KubeOne to fail to create MachineDeployment objects
  because the `machine-controller-webhook` service can't be found. Also, one of
  the NodeLocalDNS pods might get stuck in the crash loop.
  * KubeOne currently still doesn't support Kubernetes 1.20. We do **not**
    recommend provisioning 1.20 clusters or upgrading existing clusters to
    Kubernetes 1.20
  * We're currently investigating the issue. You can follow the progress
    in the issue [#1222](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/issues/1222)

## Added

* Add support for containerd container runtime ([#1180](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1180), [#1188](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1188), [#1190](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1190), [#1205](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1205), [#1227](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1227), [#1229](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1229))
  * Kubernetes has announced deprecation of the Docker (dockershim) support in

# [v1.1.0](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/releases/tag/v1.1.0) - 2020-11-13

**Changelog since v1.0.5.**

## Attention Needed

* [**Breaking**] Use Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) in the example Hetzner Terraform config ([#1102](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1102))
  * It's **highly recommended** to bind the image by setting `var.image` to the image you're currently using to prevent the instances from being recreated the next time you run Terraform!

## Added

### General

* Implement the OverwriteRegistry functionality ([#1145](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1145))
  * This PR adds a new top-level API field `registryConfiguration` which controls how images used for components deployed by KubeOne and kubeadm are pulled from an image registry.
  * The `registryConfiguration.overwriteRegisty` field specifies a custom Docker registry to be used instead of the default one.
  * The `registryConfiguration.insecureRegistry` field configures Docker to consider the registry specified in `registryConfiguration.overwriteRegisty` as an insecure registry.
  * For example, if `registryConfiguration.overwriteRegisty` is set to `127.0.0.1:5000`, image called `k8s.gcr.io/kube-apiserver:v1.19.3` would become `127.0.0.1:5000/kube-apiserver:v1.19.3`.
  * Setting `registryConfiguration.overwriteRegisty` applies to all images deployed by KubeOne and kubeadm, including addons deployed by KubeOne.
  * Setting `registryConfiguration.overwriteRegisty` applies to worker nodes managed by machine-controller and KubeOne as well.
  * You can run `kubeone config print -f` for more details regarding the RegistryConfiguration API.
* Add external cloud controller manager support for VMware vSphere clusters ([#1159](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1159))

### Addons

* Add the cluster-autoscaler addon ([#1103](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1103))

## Changed

### Bug Fixes

* Explicitly restart Kubelet when upgrading clusters running on Ubuntu ([#1098](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1098))
* Merge CloudProvider structs instead of overriding them when the cloud provider is defined via Terraform ([#1108](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1108))

### Updated

* Update Flannel to v0.13.0 ([#1135](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1135))
* Update WeaveNet to v2.7.0 ([#1153](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1153))
* Update Hetzner Cloud Controller Manager (CCM) to v1.8.1 ([#1149](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1149))
  * This CCM release includes support for external LoadBalacners backed by Hetzner LoadBalancers

### Terraform Configs

* [**Breaking**] Use Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) in the example Hetzner Terraform config ([#1102](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1102))

# [v1.0.5](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/releases/tag/v1.0.5) - 2020-10-19

## Changed

### Updated

* Update machine-controller to v1.19.0 ([#1141](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1141))
  * This machine-controller release uses the Hyperkube Kubelet image for Flatcar worker nodes running Kubernetes 1.18, as the Poseidon Kubelet image repository doesn't publish 1.18 images any longer. This change ensures that you can provision or upgrade to Kubernetes 1.18.8+ on Flatcar.

# [v1.0.4](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/releases/tag/v1.0.4) - 2020-10-16

## Attention Needed

* KubeOne now creates a dedicated secret with vSphere credentials for kube-controller-manager and vSphere Cloud Controller Manager (CCM). This is required because those components require the secret to adhere to the expected format.
  * The new secret is called `vsphere-ccm-credentials` and is deployed in the `kube-system` namespace.
  * This fix ensures that you can use all vSphere provider features, for example, volumes and having cloud provider metadata/labels applied on each node.
  * If you're upgrading an existing vSphere cluster, you should take the following steps:
    * Upgrade the cluster without changing the cloud-config. Upgrading the cluster creates a new Secret for kube-controller-manager and vSphere CCM.
    * Change the cloud-config in your KubeOne Configuration Manifest to refer to the new secret.
    * Upgrade the cluster again to apply the new cloud-config, or change it manually on each control plane node and restart kube-controller-manager and vSphere CCM (if deployed).
    * **Note: the cluster can be force-upgrade without changing the Kubernetes version. To do that, you can use the `--force-upgrade` flag with `kubeone apply`, or the `--force` flag with `kubeone upgrade`.**
* The example Terraform config for vSphere now has `disk.enableUUID` option enabled. This change ensures that you can mount volumes on the control plane nodes.
  * **WARNING: If you're applying the latest Terraform configs on an existing infrastructure/cluster, an in-place upgrade of control plane nodes is required. This means that all control plane nodes will be restarted, which causes a downtime until all instances doesn't come up again.**

## Changed

### Bug Fixes

* Don't stop Kubelet when upgrading Kubeadm on Flatcar ([#1099](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1099))
* Create a dedicated secret with vSphere credentials for kube-controller-manager and vSphere Cloud Controller Manager (CCM) ([#1128](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1128))
* Enable `disk.enableUUID` option in Terraform example configs for vSphere ([#1130](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1130))

# [v1.0.3](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/releases/tag/v1.0.3) - 2020-09-28

## Attention Needed

* This release includes a fix for Kubernetes 1.18.9 clusters failing to provision due to the unmet kubernetes-cni dependency.
* This release includes a fix for CentOS and RHEL clusters failing to provision due to missing Docker versions from the CentOS/RHEL 8 Docker repo.

## Added

* Add the `image` field for the Hetzner worker nodes ([#1105](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1105))

## Changed

### General

* Use CentOS 7 Docker repo for both CentOS/RHEL 7 and 8 clusters ([#1111](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1111))

### Updated

* Update machine-controller to v1.18.0 ([#1114](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1114))
* Update kubernetes-cni to v0.8.7 ([#1100](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1100))

# [v1.0.2](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/releases/tag/v1.0.2) - 2020-09-02

## Known Issues

* We do **not** recommend upgrading to Kubernetes 1.19.0 due to an [upstream bug in kubeadm affecting Highly-Available clusters](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubeadm/issues/2271). The bug will be fixed in 1.19.1, which is scheduled for Wednesday, September 9th. Until 1.19.1 is not released, we highly recommend staying on 1.18.

## Changed

### Updated

* Update machine-controller to v1.17.1 ([#1086](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1086))
  * This machine-controller release uses Docker 19.03.12 instead of Docker 18.06 for worker nodes running Kubernetes 1.17 and newer.
  * Due to an [upstream issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/94281), pod metrics are not available on worker nodes running Kubernetes 1.19 with Docker 18.06.
  * If you experience any issues with pod metrics on worker nodes running Kubernetes 1.19, provisioned with an earlier machine-controller version, you might have to update machine-controller to v1.17.1 and then rotate the affected worker nodes.

# [v1.0.1](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/releases/tag/v1.0.1) - 2020-08-31

## Known Issues

* We do **not** recommend upgrading to Kubernetes 1.19.0 due to an [upstream bug in kubeadm affecting Highly-Available clusters](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubeadm/issues/2271). The bug will be fixed in 1.19.1, which is scheduled for Wednesday, September 9th. Until 1.19.1 is not released, we highly recommend staying on 1.18.

## Changed

### General

* Include cloud-config in the generated KubeOne configuration manifest when it's required by validation ([#1062](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1062))

### Bug Fixes

* Properly apply labels when upgrading components. This fixes the issue with upgrade failures on clusters created with KubeOne v1.0.0-rc.0 and earlier ([#1078](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1078))
* Fix race condition between kube-proxy and node-local-dns ([#1058](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1058))

# [v1.0.0](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/releases/tag/v1.0.0) - 2020-08-18

**Changelog since v0.11.2. For changelog since v1.0.0-rc.1, please check the [release notes](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/releases/tag/v1.0.0)**

## Attention Needed

* Upgrading to this release is **highly recommended** as v0.11 release doesn't support Kubernetes versions 1.16.11/1.17.7/1.18.4 and newer. Kubernetes versions older than 1.16.11/1.17.7/1.18.4 are affected by two CVEs and therefore it's strongly advised to use 1.16.11/1.17.7/1.18.4 or newer.

* KubeOne now uses vanity domain `k8c.io/kubeone`.
  * The `go get` command to get KubeOne is now `GO111MODULE=on go get k8c.io/kubeone`.
* The `kubeone` AUR package has been moved to the official Arch Linux repositories. The AUR package has been removed in the favor of the official one.

* This release introduces the new KubeOneCluster v1beta1 API. The v1alpha1 API has been deprecated.
  * It remains possible to use both APIs with all `kubeone` commands
  * The v1alpha1 manifest can be converted to the v1beta1 manifest using the `kubeone config migrate` command
  * All example configurations have been updated to the v1beta1 API
  * More information about migrating to the new API and what has been changed can be found in the [API migration document](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubeone/master/advanced/api_migration/)
* Default MTU for the Canal CNI depending on the provider
  * AWS - 8951 (9001 AWS Jumbo Frame - 50 VXLAN bytes)
  * GCE - 1410 (GCE specific 1460 bytes - 50 VXLAN bytes)
  * Hetzner - 1400 (Hetzner specific 1450 bytes - 50 VXLAN bytes)
  * OpenStack - 1400 (OpenStack specific 1450 bytes - 50 VXLAN bytes)
  * Default - 1450
  * If you're using KubeOneCluster v1alpha1 API, the default MTU is 1450 regardless of the provider
* RHSMOfflineToken has been removed from the CloudProviderSpec. This and other relevant fields are now located in the OperatingSystemSpec

* The KubeOneCluster manifest (config file) is now provided using the `--manifest` flag, such as `kubeone install --manifest config.yaml`. Providing it as an argument will result in an error
* The paths to the config files for PodNodeSelector feature (`.features.config.configFilePath`) and StaticAuditLog
feature (`.features.staticAuditLog.policyFilePath`) are now relative to the manifest path instead of to the working
directory. This change might be breaking for some users.

* It's now possible to install Kubernetes 1.18.6 and 1.17.9 on CentOS 7, however, only Canal CNI is known to work properly. We are aware that the DNS and networking problems may still be present even with the latest versions. It remains impossible to install older versions of Kubernetes on CentOS 7.

* Example Terraform configs for AWS now Use Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) instead of Ubuntu 18.04
  * It's **highly recommended** to bind the AMI by setting `var.ami` to the AMI you're currently using to prevent the instances from being recreated the next time you run Terraform!

## Known Issues

* We do **not** recommend upgrading to Kubernetes 1.19.0 due to an [upstream bug in kubeadm affecting Highly-Available clusters](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubeadm/issues/2271). The bug will be fixed in 1.19.1, which is scheduled for Wednesday, September 9th. Until 1.19.1 is not released, we highly recommend staying on 1.18.
* It remains impossible to provision Kubernetes older than 1.18.6/1.17.9 on CentOS 7. CentOS 8 and RHEL are unaffected.
* Upgrading a cluster created with KubeOne v1.0.0-rc.0 or earlier fails to update components deployed by KubeOne (e.g. CNI, machine-controller). Please upgrade to KubeOne v1.0.1 or newer if you have clusters created with v1.0.0-rc.0 or earlier.

## Added

* Implement the `kubeone apply` command
  * The apply command is used to reconcile (install, upgrade, and repair) clusters
  * More details about how to use the apply command can be found in the [Cluster reconciliation (apply) document](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubeone/master/advanced/cluster_reconciliation/)
* Implement the `kubeone config machinedeployments` command ([#966](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/966))
  * The new command is used to generate a YAML manifest containing all MachineDeployment objects defined in the KubeOne configuration manifest and Terraform output
  * The generated manifest can be used with kubectl if you want to create and modify MachineDeployments once the cluster is created
* Add the `kubeone proxy` command ([#1035](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1035))
  * The `kubeone proxy` command launches a local HTTPS capable proxy (CONNECT method) to tunnel HTTPS request via SSH. This is especially useful in cases when the Kubernetes API endpoint is not accessible from the public internets.
* Add the KubeOneCluster v1beta1 API ([#894](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/894))
  * Implemented automated conversion between v1alpha1 and v1beta1 APIs. It remains possible to use all `kubeone` commands with both v1alpha1 and v1beta1 manifests, however, migration to the v1beta1 manifest is recommended
  * Implement the Terraform integration for the v1beta1 API. Currently, the Terraform integration output format is the same for both APIs, but that might change in the future
  * The kubeone config migrate command has been refactored to migrate v1alpha1 to v1beta1 manifests. The manifest is now provided using the --manifest flag instead of providing it as an argument. It's not possible to convert pre-v0.6.0 manifest to v1alpha1 anymore
  * The example configurations are updated to the v1beta1 API
  * Drop the leading 'v' in the Kubernetes version if it's provided. This fixes a bug causing provisioning to fail if the Kubernetes version starts with 'v'
* Automatic cluster repairs ([#888](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/888))
  * Detect and delete broken etcd members
  * Detect and delete outdated corev1.Node objects
* Add ability to provision static worker nodes ([#834](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/834))
  * Check out [the documentation](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubeone/master/workers/static_workers/) to learn more about static worker nodes
* Add ability to skip cluster provisioning when running the `install` command using the `--no-init` flag ([#871](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/871))
* Add support for Kubernetes 1.16.11, 1.17.7, 1.18.4 releases ([#925](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/925))
* Add support for Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) ([#1005](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1005))
* Add support for CentOS 8 ([#981](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/981))
* Add RHEL support ([#918](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/918))
* Add support for Flatcar Linux ([#879](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/879))
* Support for vSphere resource pools ([#883](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/883))
* Support for Azure AZs ([#883](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/883))
* Support for Flexvolumes on CoreOS and Flatcar ([#885](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/885))
* Add the `ImagePlan` field to Azure Terraform integration ([#947](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/947))
* Add support for the PodNodeSelector admission controller ([#920](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/920))
* Add the `PodPresets` feature ([#837](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/837))
* Add support for OpenStack external cloud controller manager (CCM) ([#820](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/820))
* Add ability to change MTU for the Canal CNI using `.clusterNetwork.cni.canal.mtu` field (requires KubeOneCluster v1beta1 API) ([#1005](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/1005))
* Add the Calico VXLAN addon ([#972](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/972))
  * More information about how to use this addon can be found on the [docs website](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubeone/master/using_kubeone/calico-vxlan-addon/)
* Add ability to use an external CNI plugin ([#862](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/862))

## Changed

## Known Issues

* machine-controller is failing to sign Kubelet CertificateSingingRequests (CSRs) for worker nodes on GCP due to [missing hostname in the Machine object](https://github.com/kubermatic/machine-controller/issues/781). We are currently working on a fix. In meanwhile, you can sign the CSRs manually by following [instructions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tls/managing-tls-in-a-cluster/#approving-certificate-signing-requests) from the Kubernetes docs.
* It remains impossible to provision Kubernetes 1.16.10+ clusters on CentOS 7. CentOS 8 and RHEL are unaffected. We are investigating the root cause of the issue.

## Changed

### Bug Fixes

* Remove hold from the docker-ce-cli package on upgrade ([#941](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/941))
  * This ensures clusters created with KubeOne v0.11 can be upgraded using KubeOne v1.0.0-beta.1 release

# [v1.0.0-beta.0](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.0) - 2020-07-01

## Attention Needed

* It's recommended to use this release instead of v0.11, as v0.11 doesn't support the latest Kubernetes patch releases. Older Kubernetes releases are affected by two CVEs and therefore it's strongly advised to use 1.16.11/1.17.7/1.18.4 or newer.

## Known Issues

* machine-controller is failing to sign Kubelet CertificateSingingRequests (CSRs) for worker nodes on GCP due to [missing hostname in the Machine object](https://github.com/kubermatic/machine-controller/issues/781). We are currently working on a fix. In meanwhile, you can sign the CSRs manually by following [instructions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tls/managing-tls-in-a-cluster/#approving-certificate-signing-requests) from the Kubernetes docs.
* It remains impossible to provision Kubernetes 1.16.10+ clusters on CentOS 7. CentOS 8 and RHEL are unaffected. We are investigating the root cause of the issue.
* Trying to upgrade cluster created with KubeOne v0.11.2 or older results in an error due to KubeOne failing to upgrade the `docker-ce-cli` package. This issue has been fixed in the v1.0.0-beta.1 release.

## Changed

### General

* Re-introduce the support for the kubernetes-cni package and use the proper revision for Kubernetes packages ([#933](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/933))
  * This change ensures operators can use KubeOne to install the latest Kubernetes releases on CentOS/RHEL

### Bug Fixes

* Stop copying kubeconfig to the home directory on control plane instances ([#936](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/936))
  * This fixes the issue with upgrading CoreOS/Flatcar clusters

### Updated

* Update machine-controller to v1.14.3 ([#937](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/937))

# [v1.0.0-alpha.6](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/releases/tag/v1.0.0-alpha.6) - 2020-06-19

## Changed

### General

* Fix CoreOS/Flatcar cluster provisioning/upgrading: use the correct URL for the CNI plugins ([#929](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/929))

# [v1.0.0-alpha.5](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/releases/tag/v1.0.0-alpha.5) - 2020-06-18

## Attention Needed

* This release includes support for Kubernetes releases 1.16.11, 1.17.7, and 1.18.4. Those releases use the CNI v0.8.6,
which includes a fix for the CVE-2020-10749. It's **strongly advised** to upgrade your clusters and rotate worker nodes
as soon as possible.
* The path to the config file for PodNodeSelector feature (`.features.config.configFilePath`) and StaticAuditLog
feature (`.features.staticAuditLog.policyFilePath`) are now relative to the manifest path instead of to the working
directory. This change might be breaking for some users.

## Known Issues

* Currently it's impossible to install Kubernetes versions older than 1.16.11/1.17.7/1.18.4 on CentOS/RHEL, due
to an issue with packages.
* Currently it's impossible to install Kubernetes on CentOS 7. The 1.16.11 release is not working due to an [upstream
issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/92250) with the kube-proxy component, while newer releases are
having DNS problems which we are investigating.
* Currently it's impossible to install Kubernetes on CoreOS/Flatcar due to an incorrect URL
to the CNI plugin. The fix has been already merged and will be included in the upcoming release.

## Added

* Add RHEL support ([#918](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/918))
* Add support for the PodNodeSelector admission controller ([#920](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/920))
* Add support for Kubernetes 1.16.11, 1.17.7, 1.18.4 releases ([#925](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/925))

## Changed

### General

* BREAKING: Make paths to the config file for PodNodeSelector and StaticAuditLog features relative to the manifest path ([#920](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/920))

### Updated

* Update machine-controller to v1.14.2 ([#918](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/918))

# [v1.0.0-alpha.4](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/releases/tag/v1.0.0-alpha.4) - 2020-05-21

## Changed

### General

* Fix the Kubelet service unit for CoreOS/Flatcar ([#908](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/908), [#909](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/909))

# [v1.0.0-alpha.3](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/releases/tag/v1.0.0-alpha.3) - 2020-05-21

## Attention Needed

* In the v1.0.0-alpha.2 release, we didn't explicitly hold the `docker-ce-cli` package, which means it can be upgraded to a newer version. Upgrading the `docker-ce-cli` package would render the Kubernetes cluster unusable because of the version mismatch between Docker daemon and CLI.
* If you already provisioned a cluster using the v1.0.0-alpha.2 release, please hold the `docker-ce-cli` package to prevent it from being upgraded:
  * Ubuntu: run the following command over SSH on all control plane instances: `sudo apt-mark hold docker-ce-cli`
  * CentOS: we've started using `yum versionlock` to handle package locks. The best way to set it up on your control plane instances is to run `kubeone upgrade -f` with the exact same config that's currently running.

## Known Issues

* The CoreOS cluster provisioning has been broken in this release due to the incorrect formatted Kubelet service file. This issue has been fixed in the v1.0.0-alpha.4 release.

## Changed

### General

* Hold the `docker-ce-cli` package on Ubuntu ([#902](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/902))
* Hold the `docker-ce`, `docker-ce-cli`, and all Kubernetes packages on CentOS ([#902](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/902))
* Fix the CoreOS install and upgrade scripts ([#904](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/904))

# [v1.0.0-alpha.2](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/releases/tag/v1.0.0-alpha.2) - 2020-05-20

## Attention Needed

* This alpha version fixes the provisioning failures caused by `docker-ce-cli` version mismatch. The older alpha release are not working anymore ([#896](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/896))
* `machine-controller` must be updated to v1.14.0 or newer on existing clusters or otherwise newly created worker nodes will not work properly. The `machine-controller` can be updated on one of the following ways:
  * (Recommended) Run `kubeone upgrade -f` with the exact same config that's currently running
  * Run `kubeone install` with the exact same config that's currently running
  * Update the `machine-controller` and `machine-controller-webhook` deployments manually
* This release introduces the new KubeOneCluster v1beta1 API. The v1alpha1 API has been deprecated.
  * It remains possible to use both APIs with all `kubeone` commands
  * The v1alpha1 manifest can be converted to the v1beta1 manifest using the `kubeone config migrate` command
  * All example configurations have been updated to the v1beta1 API

## Known Issues

* The `docker-ce-cli` package is not put on hold after it's installed. Upgrading the `docker-ce-cli` package would render the Kubernetes cluster unusable because of the version mismatch between Docker daemon and CLI. It's highly recommended to upgrade to KubeOne v1.0.0-alpha.3.
* If you already provisioned a cluster using the v1.0.0-alpha.2 release, please hold the `docker-ce-cli` package to prevent it from being upgraded:
  * Ubuntu: run the following command over SSH on all control plane instances: `sudo apt-mark hold docker-ce-cli`
  * CentOS: we've started using `yum versionlock` to handle package locks. The best way to set it up on your control plane instances is to run `kubeone upgrade -f` with the exact same config that's currently running.
* The CoreOS cluster provisioning has been broken in this release due to the incorrect formatted Kubelet service file. This issue has been fixed in the v1.0.0-alpha.4 release.

## Added

* Add the KubeOneCluster v1beta1 API ([#894](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/894))
  * Implemented automated conversion between v1alpha1 and v1beta1 APIs. It remains possible to use all `kubeone` commands with both v1alpha1 and v1beta1 manifests, however, migration to the v1beta1 manifest is recommended
  * Implement the Terraform integration for the v1beta1 API. Currently, the Terraform integration output format is the same for both APIs, but that might change in the future
  * The kubeone config migrate command has been refactored to migrate v1alpha1 to v1beta1 manifests. The manifest is now provided using the --manifest flag instead of providing it as an argument. It's not possible to convert pre-v0.6.0 manifest to v1alpha1 anymore
  * The example configurations are updated to the v1beta1 API
  * Drop the leading 'v' in the Kubernetes version if it's provided. This fixes a bug causing provisioning to fail if the Kubernetes version starts with 'v'

## Changed

# [v1.0.0-alpha.1](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/releases/tag/v1.0.0-alpha.1) - 2020-05-11

## Attention Needed

* The KubeOneCluster manifest (config file) is now provided using the `--manifest` flag, such as `kubeone install --manifest config.yaml`. Providing it as an argument will result in an error
* RHSMOfflineToken has been removed from the CloudProviderSpec. This and other relevant fields are now located in the OperatingSystemSpec
* Packet Cloud Controller Manager (CCM) has been updated to v1.0.0. This update fixes the issue preventing users to provision new Packet clusters

## Added

# [v0.4.0](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/releases/tag/v0.4.0) - 2019-03-21

## Action Required

* In [#264](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/264) the environment variable names were changed to match names used by Terraform. In order for KubeOne to correctly fetch credentials you need to use the following variables:
  * `DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN` instead of `DO_TOKEN`
  * `OS_USERNAME` instead of `OS_USER_NAME`
  * `HCLOUD_TOKEN` instead of `HZ_TOKEN`
* The `cloud-config` file is now required for OpenStack clusters. Validation will fail if the `cloud-config` is not provided. See the [OpenStack quickstart](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/blob/v0.4.0/docs/quickstart-openstack.md) for details how the `cloud-config` file should look like.
* Ark integration is removed from KubeOne in [#265](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/265). You need to remove the `backups` section from the existing configuration files. If you wish to deploy Ark on new clusters you have to do it manually.

* The environment variable names are changed to match names used by Terraform ([#264](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/264))

## Removed

* Option for deploying Ark is removed ([#265](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/265))

# [v0.3.0](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/releases/tag/v0.3.0) - 2019-03-08

## Action Required

* If you're using `provider.Name` `external` to configure control plane nodes to work with external CCM you need to:
    * Set `provider.Name` to name of the cloud provider you're using or to `none` (see [`config.yaml.dist`](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/blob/v0.3.0/config.yaml.dist) for supported values),
    * Set `provider.External` to `true`.
    * **Note: using external CCM is not supported and is currently not working as expected.**
* If you're using `provider.Name` `none`:
    * If you're deploying `machine-controller` you need to set `MachineController.Provider` to name of the cloud provider you're using for worker nodes,
    * Otherwise you need to set `MachineController.Deploy` to `false`, so validation passes.

## Added

* Add support for cluster upgrades ([#206](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/206), [#211](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/211), [#214](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/214))

## Changed

* Fix `none` provider bugs and ensure correct behavior ([#227](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/227))
* External Cloud Controller Manager is now enabled by setting `Provider.External` to `true` instead of setting `Provider.Name` to `external` ([#230](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/230), [#237](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/237))
* Set correct Internal address on nodes with 2+ network interfaces ([#240](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/pull/240))
