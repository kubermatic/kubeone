## Installation

We strongly recommend that you use an [official release][3] of KubeOne. The tarballs for each release contain the
command-line client **and** version-specific sample YAML files for deploying KubeOne to your cluster.
Follow the instructions under the **Install** section of [our documentation][21] to get started.

_The code and sample YAML files in the master branch of the KubeOne repository are under active development and are not guaranteed to be stable. Use them at your own risk!_

## More information

[The documentation][21] provides a getting started guide, plus information about building from source, architecture, extending KubeOne, and more.

Please use the version selector at the top of the site to ensure you are using the appropriate documentation for your version of KubeOne.
