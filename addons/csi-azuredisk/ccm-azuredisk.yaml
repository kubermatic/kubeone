                description: readyToUse indicates if a snapshot is ready to be used to restore a volume. In dynamic snapshot creation case, this field will be filled in by the CSI snapshotter sidecar with the "ready_to_use" value returned from CSI "CreateSnapshot" gRPC call. For a pre-existing snapshot, this field will be filled with the "ready_to_use" value returned from the CSI "ListSnapshots" gRPC call if the driver supports it, otherwise, this field will be set to "True". If not specified, it means the readiness of a snapshot is unknown.

              restoreSize:
                description: restoreSize represents the complete size of the snapshot in bytes. In dynamic snapshot creation case, this field will be filled in by the CSI snapshotter sidecar with the "size_bytes" value returned from CSI "CreateSnapshot" gRPC call. For a pre-existing snapshot, this field will be filled with the "size_bytes" value returned from the CSI "ListSnapshots" gRPC call if the driver supports it. When restoring a volume from this snapshot, the size of the volume MUST NOT be smaller than the restoreSize if it is specified, otherwise the restoration will fail. If not specified, it indicates that the size is unknown.
