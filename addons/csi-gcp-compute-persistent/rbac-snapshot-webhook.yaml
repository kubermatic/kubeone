# RBAC file for the snapshot webhook.
#
# The snapshot webhook implements the validation and admission for CSI snapshot functionality.
# It should be installed as part of the base Kubernetes distribution in an appropriate
# namespace for components implementing base system functionality. For installing with
# Vanilla Kubernetes, kube-system makes sense for the namespace.
