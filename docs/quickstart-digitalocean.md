# How To Install Kubernetes On DigitalOcean Cluster Using KubeOne

In this quick start we're going to show how to get started with KubeOne on DigitalOcean. We'll cover how to create the needed infrastructure using our example Terraform scripts and then install Kubernetes. Finally, we're going to show how to destroy the cluster along with the infrastructure.

As a result, you'll get Kubernetes 1.16.1 High-Available (HA) clusters with three control plane nodes and one worker node.

### Prerequisites

To follow this quick start, you'll need:

* `kubeone` v0.11.1 or newer installed, which can be done by following the `Installing KubeOne` section of [the README](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/blob/master/README.md),
* `terraform` v0.12.0 or later installed. Older releases are not compatible. The binaries for `terraform` can be found on the [Terraform website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)

## Setting Up Credentials

In order for Terraform to successfully create the infrastructure and for KubeOne to install Kubernetes and create worker nodes you need an API Access Token with read and write permissions. You can refer to [the official documentation](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/api/create-personal-access-token/) for guidelines for generating the token.

Once you have the API access token you need to set the `DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN` environment variable containing the token:

```bash
export DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN=...
```

**Note:** The API access token is deployed to the cluster to be used by `machine-controller` for creating worker nodes.

## Creating Infrastructure

KubeOne is based on the Bring-Your-Own-Infra approach, which means that you have to provide machines and needed resources yourself. To make this task easier we are providing Terraform scripts that you can use to get started. You're free to use your own scripts or any other preferred approach.

The Terraform scripts for DigitalOcean are located in the [`./examples/terraform/digitalocean`](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/tree/master/examples/terraform/digitalocean) directory.

**Note:** KubeOne comes with Terraform integration that is capable of reading information about the infrastructure from Terraform output. If you decide not to use our Terraform scripts but want to use Terraform integration, make sure variable names in the output match variable names used by KubeOne. Alternatively, if you decide not to use Terraform, you can provide needed information about the infrastructure manually in the KubeOne configuration file.

First, we need to switch to the directory with Terraform scripts:

```bash
cd ./examples/terraform/digitalocean
```

Before we can use Terraform to create the infrastructure for us, Terraform needs to download the DigitalOcean plugin and setup it's environment. This is done by running the `init` command:

```bash
terraform init
```

**Note:** You need to run this command only the first time before using scripts.

You may want to configure the provisioning process by setting variables defining the cluster name, Droplets region, size and similar. The easiest way is to create the `terraform.tfvars` file and store variables there. This file is automatically read by Terraform.

```bash
nano terraform.tfvars
```

For the list of available settings along with their names please see the [`variables.tf`](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/blob/master/examples/terraform/digitalocean/variables.tf) file. You should consider setting:

* `cluster_name` (required) - prefix for cloud resources
* `region` (default: fra1)
* `ssh_public_key_file` (default: `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`) - path to your SSH public key that's deployed on instances
* `droplet_size` (default: s-2vcpu-4gb) - note that you should have at least 2 GB RAM and 2 CPUs for Kubernetes to work properly

The `terraform.tfvars` file can look like:

```
cluster_name = "demo"

region = "fra1"
```

Now that you configured Terraform you can use the `plan` command to see what changes will be made:

```bash
terraform plan
```

Finally, if you agree with changes you can proceed and provision the infrastructure:

```bash
terraform apply
```

Shortly after you'll be asked to enter `yes` to confirm your intention to provision the infrastructure.

Infrastructure provisioning takes around 5 minutes.

## Installing Kubernetes

Now that you have infrastructure you can proceed with installing Kubernetes using KubeOne.

Before you start you'll need a configuration file that defines how Kubernetes
will be installed, e.g. what version will be used and what features will be
enabled. For the configuration file reference run `kubeone config print --full`.

To get started you can use the following configuration. It'll install Kubernetes 1.16.1, create one worker node and deploy the [external cloud controller manager](https://github.com/digitalocean/digitalocean-cloud-controller-manager). The external cloud controller manager takes care of providing correct information about nodes from the DigitalOcean API and allows you to use the `type: LoadBalancer` services. KubeOne automatically populates information about the worker nodes from the [Terraform output](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/blob/ec8bf305446ac22529e9683fd4ce3c9abf753d1e/examples/terraform/digitalocean/output.tf#L38-L59). Alternatively, you can set those information manually. As KubeOne is using [Kubermatic `machine-controller`](https://github.com/kubermatic/machine-controller) for creating worker nodes, see [DigitalOcean example manifest](https://github.com/kubermatic/machine-controller/blob/master/examples/digitalocean-machinedeployment.yaml) for available options.

For example, to create a cluster with Kubernetes `1.16.1`, save the following to
`config.yaml`:
```yaml
apiVersion: kubeone.io/v1alpha1
kind: KubeOneCluster
versions:
  kubernetes: '1.16.1'
cloudProvider:
  name: 'digitalocean'
  external: true
```

**Note:** It is recommended to enable private networking so cluster can function properly.

Finally, we're going to install Kubernetes by using the `install` command and providing the configuration file and the Terraform output:

```bash
kubeone install config.yaml --tfjson <DIR-WITH-tfstate-FILE>
```

**Note:** `--tfjson` accepts a file as well as a directory containing the
terraform state file. To pass a file, generate the JSON output by running the
following and use it as the value for the `--tfjson` flag:
```bash
terraform output -json > tf.json
```

Alternatively, if the terraform state file is in the current working directory
 `--tfjson .` can be used as well.

The installation process takes some time, usually 5-10 minutes. The output should look like the following one:

```

KubeOne automatically downloads the Kubeconfig file for the cluster. It's named
as **\<cluster_name>-kubeconfig**, where **\<cluster_name>** is the name from
your configuration. You can use it with kubectl such as

```bash
kubectl --kubeconfig=<cluster_name>-kubeconfig
```

or export the `KUBECONFIG` variable environment variable:
```bash
export KUBECONFIG=$PWD/<cluster_name>-kubeconfig
```

## Scaling Worker Nodes

Worker nodes are managed by the machine-controller. It creates initially only one and can be
scaled up and down (including to 0) using the Kubernetes API. To do so you first got to retrieve
the `machinedeployments` by

```bash
kubectl get machinedeployments -n kube-system
```

The names of the `machinedeployments` are generated. You can scale the workers in those via

```bash
kubectl --namespace kube-system scale machinedeployment/<MACHINE-DEPLOYMENT-NAME> --replicas=3
```

**Note:** The `kubectl scale` command is not working as expected with `kubectl` 1.15,
returning an error such as:

```
The machinedeployments "<MACHINE-DEPLOYMENT-NAME>" is invalid: metadata.resourceVersion: Invalid value: 0x0: must be specified for an update
```

For a workaround, please follow the steps described in the [issue 593][scale_issue] or upgrade to `kubectl` 1.16 or newer.

## Deleting The Cluster

Before deleting a cluster you should clean up all MachineDeployments, so all worker nodes are deleted. You can do it with the `kubeone reset` command:

```bash
kubeone reset config.yaml --tfjson <DIR-WITH-tfstate-FILE>
```

This command will wait for all worker nodes to be gone. Once it's done you can proceed and destroy the DigitalOcean infrastructure using Terraform:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

You'll be asked to enter `yes` to confirm your intention to destroy the cluster.

Congratulations! You're now running Kubernetes 1.16.1 HA cluster with three control plane nodes and one worker node.
