# Addons

Addons are a mechanism used to deploy Kubernetes resources after provisioning the cluster. 
Addons allow operators to use KubeOne to deploy various stacks, such as logging and monitoring,
backups and recovery, log rotating, and more.

This document explains how to use addons in your workflow. If you want to learn more about how
addons are implemented, you can check the [design proposal][design-proposal] for more details.

## Writing Addons

Addons are represented as Kubernetes YAML manifests. To deploy an addon, the operator
needs to put a YAML manifest in a directory and provide it as the addons directory in
the KubeOne cluster configuration.

### Templating

Manifests support templating based on [Go templates][go-templates]. The following data
is available out of the box:
* KubeOne cluster configuration - `.Config` 
* Credentials - `.Credentials`

On top of that, you can use the [`sprig`][sprig] functions in your templates. For list
of available functions, consider the [`sprig` docs][sprig-docs].

### Example

The following snippet shows how an addon looks like and how to use templating:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: example-{{ .Config.Name }} # will be rendered as 'example-cluster_name'
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: credentials
  namespace: kube-system
type: Opaque
data:
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: {{ .Credentials.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | b64enc }} # will be rendered as base64-encoded AWS access key
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: {{ .Credentials.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | b64enc }} # will be rendered as base64-encoded AWS secret access key
```

**Note:** The `b64enc` function is a [`sprig` function][sprig-b64enc].

## Enabling Addons

To enable addons, you need to modify the KubeOne cluster configuration to add the
`addons` config:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubeone.io/v1alpha1
kind: KubeOneCluster
versions:
  kubernetes: 1.16.1
cloudProvider:
  name: aws
# Addons are Kubernetes manifests to be deployed after provisioning the cluster
addons:
  enable: false
  # In case when the relative path is provided, the path is relative
  # to the KubeOne configuration file.
  path: "./addons"
```

**Note:** The addons path is normalized on the runtime. If you provide a relative path,
the path is relative to the KubeOne configuration file. This means that `./addons` will be
parsed depending on the `kubeone` command you use:
* `kubeone install config.yaml` - `./addons`
* `kubeone install other/dir/config.yaml` - `./other/dir/addons/config.yaml`

**Note:** Subdirectories are not considered when applying addons. Only addons in the root
of the provided directory will be applied.

## Reconciling Addons

The addons are reconciled after creating/upgrading worker nodes when running `kubeone install`
or `kubeone upgrade`. The reconciliation is done using `kubectl` over SSH, using a command such as:
```
kubectl apply -f addons.yaml --prune -l kubeone.io/addon
```

Using the `--prune` options means that the next time you run `kubeone`:
* if you updated any manifest, the corresponding resources in the cluster will be updated,
* if you removed a resource from a manifest, the resource will be removed from the cluster as well
* if you removed a whole manifest, all resources defined in that manifest will be removed from the cluster

**Note:** The `--prune` option can be **dangerous**. Always make sure that you have all needed manifests present
in the addons directory and correct addons configuration before running `kubeone`.

The addons are applied in the alphabetical order. This means that you can control in which order addons
will be applied by setting the appropriate file name.
